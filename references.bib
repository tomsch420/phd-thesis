abstract = {Probabilistic programs are usual functional or imperative programs with two added constructs: (1) the ability to draw values at random from distributions, and (2) the ability to condition values of variables in a program via observations. Models from diverse application areas such as computer vision, coding theory, cryptographic protocols, biology and reliability analysis can be written as probabilistic programs.  Probabilistic inference is the problem of computing an explicit representation of the probability distribution implicitly specified by a probabilistic program. Depending on the application, the desired output from inference may vary---we may want to estimate the expected value of some function f with respect to the distribution, or the mode of the distribution, or simply a set of samples drawn from the distribution.  In this paper, we describe connections this research area called ``Probabilistic Programming" has with programming languages and software engineering, and this includes language design, and the static and dynamic analysis of programs. We survey current state of the art and speculate on promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {Given a probabilistic world model, an important problem is to find the maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) instantiation of all the random variables given the evidence. Numerous researchers using such models employ some graph representation for the distributions, such as a Bayesian belief network. This representation simplifies the complexity of specifying the distributions from exponential in n, the number of variables in the model, to linear in n, in many interesting cases. We show, however, that finding the MAP is NP-hard in the general case when these representations are used, even if the size of the representation happens to be linear in n. Furthermore, minor modifications to the proof show that the problem remains NP-hard for various restrictions of the topology of the graphs. The same technique can be applied to the results of a related paper (by Cooper), to further restrict belief network topology in the proof that probabilistic inference is NP-hard.}

An SPN is either a univariate distribution, a product of SPNs over disjoint variables, or a weighted sum of SPNs over the same variables. We propose the first algorithm for learning the structure of SPNs that takes full advantage of their expressiveness. At each step, the algorithm attempts to divide the current variables into approximately independent subsets. If successful, it returns the product of recursive calls on the subsets; otherwise it returns the sum of recursive calls on subsets of similar instances from the current training set. A comprehensive empirical study shows that the learned SPNs are typically comparable to graphical models in likelihood but superior in inference speed and accuracy.}

SPNs generalize many other tractable models, including thin junction trees, latent tree models, and many types of mixtures.  Previous work on learning SPN structure has mainly focused on using top-down or bottom-up clustering to find mixtures, which capture variable interactions indirectly through implicit latent variables.  In contrast, most work on learning graphical models, thin junction trees, and arithmetic circuits has focused on finding direct interactions among variables.  In this paper, we present ID-SPN, a new algorithm for learning SPN structure that unifies the two approaches. In experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, we find that the combination of direct and indirect interactions leads to significantly better accuracy than several state-of-the-art algorithms for learning SPNs and other tractable models.}
