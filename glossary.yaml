  description: A _sample_ in the context of this work may either be _microscopic_ or _macroscopic_. A macroscopic (_macro_) sample can be used to obtain material properties directly because of its size. Macro samples can for example be created by using spray-forming or casting. A microscopic or _micro_ sample is a spherical droplet of a few hundred $mu m$ in diameter. These samples are either generated in large quantities in one go using the pneumatic high-temperature droplet generator as described by @1757-899X-117-1-012057 or they are formed in a larger-scale sample using Laser Deep Alloying."
